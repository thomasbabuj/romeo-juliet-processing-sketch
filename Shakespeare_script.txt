R# Lady, by yondar blessed moon I vow,
R# That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops ---

J# O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
J# That monthly changes in her circled orb,
J# Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

R# What shall I swear by?

J# Do not swear at all.
J# Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
J# Which is the god of my idolatry,
J# And I'll believe thee.
